# Reach for the Keys

Someone told me once "People want to know how bitcoin makes them wealthy, not how to safely use it." They want to be in the passenger seat and reap the benefits with the least effort. It needs to be convenient and fast. Same with privacy. Cash is being replaced with digital payments that leave trails everywhere. Giving away your habits, your relationships, your location. But it's convenient. 

Sitting in the driver's seat and taking responsibility is much harder, but it pays much more in the long run. Agency, self-determination and control.

Surveillance capitalism wants passengers. Compliant. Trackable. Dependent. The driver's seat is always available, but you have to reach for the keys yourself.
