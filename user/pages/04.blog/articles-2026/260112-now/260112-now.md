# What I'm doing now - January 2026

## Planning Work and Travels 

I am in snowy and freezing Austria enjoying hot saunas and preparing for my Africa journey from end of Jan to mid May. That means finishing all tasks that can only be done here like backup revision, medical checks, travel vaccinations, insurance, packing or finding a garage to store my stuff.

I will speak at the Adopting Bitcoin conference in Cape Town. South Africa is in my experience the country with one of the most opportunities to use bitcoin as money next to Kenya where you can spend everywhere through the Tando app. 

After that we will be traveling to Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique to visit and support local communities. We are working on the educational program which will include topics as digital security, privacy, decentralized networks such as Bitcoin and [Nostr](https://anitaposch.com/nostr) as well as Ecash and are raising funds right now. If you want to [support the mission of Bitcoin for Fairness feel free to donate](https://bffbtc.org/donate).

Finally my right hand has healed after my carpal tunnel surgery last June.
